Update on 11/7/2021

We have uploaded the exercises in each chapter.

We firstly completed the version control and toy example in the `master` branch. Then we realized we should set a new branch for every chapter's exercise to avoid mistakes. That's why we have many branches. 

Today, for convenience, I have merged all branches into a new branch `main` except `feature-1` since it will incur conflict between files in the toy example.

Sorry, I noticed I made a mistake in the toy example. I fixed it in the `feature-1`. It will not affect the `main` branch.
